# Nextra

**Nextra** is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create Markdown-based content with ease.

## Quick Start

If you want to use Nextra without a preset theme, or build your own theme, you can follow the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.
